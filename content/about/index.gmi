# About

Hi! I like to make things.

I am primarily a full-stack web developer, focusing on Phoenix and Rails applications.

I like to design hardware as well, from basic circuits and PCBs to 3D-printed objects and enclosures. But nobody pays me for that. And they're probably right.

If you look up, you might see me buzzing around in my 1977 Piper Archer II.

I have two cats and the best wife ever.
