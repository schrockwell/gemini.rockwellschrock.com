	<li><strong>Trip meter:</strong> 730 miles</li>
	<li><strong>Time:</strong> 14 hours</li>
	<li><strong>From:</strong> Zanesville, OH <strong>To:</strong> Springfield, MO</li>
	<li><strong>Summary:</strong> Caught a tornado-warned cell in southwestern MO on a marginal day</li>
</ul>
<p>So the <span class="caps">SPC</span> put in a slight risk area down around the Ozarks. I woke up in eastern Ohio. &#8220;Challenge accepted&#8221;, I thought to myself as I rose out of bed at 6 AM. I finally hit the road at 7:30 and drove and drove and drove and drove.</p>
<p>Columbus? No problem! Indianapolis? Been there. St. Louis? Done it.</p>
<p>The setup looked questionable all day. The day started muggy, but dried out as the temperature rose into the upper 80&#8217;s. There was some ongoing convection from the night before, but it dried up as the sun rose higher. By 4 PM I had made it through St. Louis without incident, but the sky still resembled a calm spring day. I had no real target for the afternoon, since it was essentially a race to get as far as possible into the area of good air.</p>
<p>Four o&#8217;clock rolled around and the radar scope started lighting up with a dozen little cells. I could see them going up off the distance, amidst the haze. I continued trucking southwest on I-44.</p>
<p>Right before Lebanon, a road sign flashed: &#8220;<span class="caps">ACCIDENT</span> <span class="caps">AHEAD</span>. 45 <span class="caps">MINUTE</span> <span class="caps">DELAY</span>.&#8221; No way. This can&#8217;t be happening, not now. I pulled off and attempted to detour around the accident by venturing onto the local backroads, aiming for Springfield, MO, so I could rejoin the interstate there. It was soon that I realized the comedy of errors playing itself out:</p>
<p><span class="caps">MISTAKE</span> #1: I had forgotten to fill up the gas tank. I barely had enough gas left to limp into Springfield.</p>
<p><span class="caps">MISTAKE</span> #2: Those roads are windy. And tree-y. You can&#8217;t see anything back there.</p>
<p><span class="caps">MISTAKE</span> #3: Good luck getting cell phone reception, much less a reliable data connection.</p>
<p>So there I was, chasing half-blind with some old radar data and windy, barely-paved roads. I caught myself laughing at the absurdity of it all.</p>
<p>Well, it turns out some of those backwoods towns are more substantial than I thought, and I was able to fill the gas tank. I glanced at the radar and saw a small cell about 20 miles to the west that had uncharacteristically split into two storms, with the right-hand taking a hard right-turn and strengthening. This &#8220;right-split&#8221; storm is commonly seen in highly-sheared environments, but not in a marginal day like today. This gave me a good feeling, and its motion was slow and in the right direction. Seeing no better options, I continued west, directly towards it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/jk-_MTM-jRCjbXtlXZOMSA?feat=directlink"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_8Y30e9LNsno/TcyfFSQRtLI/AAAAAAAADDY/ZR0w_KKGRxU/s400/DSC_7449.JPG" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>Bam! Not two minutes later, the storm received a tornado warning! Elation. It might have been small, but it looked good on radar, and had a little bit of a weak velocity couplet, indicating a rotation mesocyclone. Things were looking up! Haze was obscuring the storm, so I hoped I could get there in time.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/lz_DhAGWgA8wGQd64-2iow?feat=directlink"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_8Y30e9LNsno/TcyfFpqDT0I/AAAAAAAADDc/Nb1PostCtmU/s400/DSC_7453.JPG" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>The structure made itself apparent as I meandered through some small towns and into more open country where I could see the dang thing. Overall, it had a nice look to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/eOnihJexHxWr3sH0jTt0kQ?feat=directlink"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_8Y30e9LNsno/TcyfGEml97I/AAAAAAAADDg/oJMjXed_3K0/s400/DSC_7457.JPG" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>There was some wild motion underneath it. I was still rather far away, but I saw some dust or condensation rising into the base, originating from the ground. It was in a narrow spot, and I thought at first it could have been the start of a rotating funnel, but nothing else ever became of it. It was likely just some dirt being kicked up by a localized downburst.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/VMFGCTw36YJ9xe7YgrXwHw?feat=directlink"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_8Y30e9LNsno/TcyfG7v4HlI/AAAAAAAADDs/fJrpJnRAHqY/s400/DSC_7471.JPG" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>I had gotten to the cell as it was dying. I let the storm pass directly to my north and felt the cool downdraft as it passed me by. I jogged in front of it once more, but there was no more cool structure to see, so I set my sights on Springfield.</p>
<p>Today, I accomplished 100% of what I had planned, and I was on one of only two tornado-warned cells in Missouri. After a 700 mile drive to get there, consdiering everything that might have gone wrong in between, I&#8217;d say this day was a complete success.</p>
<p>Did I get a little lucky? Of course. But when you&#8217;re chasing, sometimes that&#8217;s all you&#8217;ve got to rely on.</p>
<p>Some barbeque and a Boulevard later, I&#8217;m ready to dream of gumdrops and supercells. Good night!</p>
